[PDX Dev Week][1] is a community-driven meta event that showcases the best events, activities and spaces for developers in Portland, OR. It is modeled after last year's [Vancouver Dev Week][2]. The [CascadiaJS conference][3] is coming to Portland on 7/31 and 8/1, so PDX Dev Week will run roughly from July 28th to August 3rd.

The purpose of a Dev Week is two-fold:
* To better connect developers from different communities (JS, Python, Gaming, etc) to one another.
* To showcase the caliber of the Portland developer community to visitors during the week.

## How to get your event listed

Portland Dev Week can't happen without an amazing array of events for developers to check-out. If you are an event organizer, here are some simple steps for getting your event listed:


* First, [check to see][1] what other events are scheduled. Ideally we work together to space out events over the course of the week.
* Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com) if you don't have one already.
* Go to our [issues page](https://github.com/cascadiajs/pdx.devweek.org/issues/new)
* Create a 'New Issue', with the title of the issue being the name of your event. Include the following info:
  * Date(s)
  * Start Time
  * End Time (optional)
  * Location
  * Link to logo image (100 x 100 pixels)
  * Link to webpage
  * Brief description (1-3 sentences)
* Send an email to pdx@devweek.org with a link to the issue you've created. This way we'll have your email address if we need to contact you.
